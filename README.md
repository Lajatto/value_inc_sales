# Value Inc Sales Dashboard

## <a href="https://lajatto.github.io/">Back to homepage</a>

**Project description:** Value Inc is a retail store that sells household items all over the world by bulk. 

The Sales Manager has no sales reporting but he has a brief idea of current sales. He also has no idea of the monthly cost, profit and top selling products. He wants a
dashboard on this and says the data is currently stored in an excel sheet. 

I used Python to clean the dataset and do some analysis. Data visualization was done in Tableau. Check out the dashboard <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/ValueIncSales_16820587557630/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">here.</a>
